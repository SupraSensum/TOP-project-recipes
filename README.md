This is the first project in The Odin Project. We'll be showing recipes to show off what's been learned so far, such as:
    - Boilerplates
    - Proper HTML element usage
    - Headers
    - Lists
    - Relative and absolute links
    - Images
    - Text manipulation for accesibility purposes: bold, italic
    - etc.

The lesson called for the creation of a dedicated repo... but I am stubborn and want to keep this all within a single repo on a single website. I'm looking forward to what potential problems this might cause down the road.
