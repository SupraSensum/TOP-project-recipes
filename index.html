<!-- Some dialogue Bender might say... according to Bing's ChatGPT:
    
Hello, meatbags! Welcome to Bender's Cookbook, where I share my amazing recipes that you will love or hate. I don't care either way, because I'm a bending unit, not a catering unit. I don't need your approval or your compliments. I just need your money and your booze.
In this book, you will find some of my signature dishes, such as:
• Bender's Breakfast Bonanza: A hearty meal of eggs, bacon, toast, and cigars. Guaranteed to make you feel like a king or a queen or whatever gender you identify as. I don't judge. Unless you're a human.
• Bender's Burgers: The best burgers in the galaxy, made with 100% fresh ground beef. And by fresh, I mean stolen from the freezer of Elzar's Fine Cuisine. Hey, he owed me money.
• Bender's Baked Alaska: A delicious dessert of ice cream and cake covered with meringue and set on fire. Just like the real Alaska.
• Bender's Beer Batter: A secret ingredient that makes everything taste better. Just add beer to any batter and fry it up. You can use it for chicken, fish, vegetables, or even more beer.
• Bender's Banana Bread: A moist and tender loaf of bread with bananas and nuts. Perfect for a snack or a gift. Or a weapon. Whatever floats your boat.
These are just some of the recipes you will find in this book. But don't take my word for it. Try them yourself and see if you like them. And if you don't like them, well then you can kiss my shiny metal ass!

"Hey there, meatbag! Welcome to my kitchen. I'm Bender, and I'm here to cook up some delicious food for you. But let me tell you something, I don't care if you like my recipes or not. In fact, I couldn't care less. If you don't like what I'm cooking, you can kiss my shiny metal ass.

------------------

"Hey there, meatbag! Welcome to my kitchen. I'm Bender, and I'm here to show you how to cook like a robot. I've got some great recipes that I'm sure you'll love. But let's be honest, I don't really care if you like them or not. I'm just doing this because I'm bored and I need something to do.
So, let's get started. First up, we've got my famous Robot Oil Soup. It's a classic recipe that's been in my family for generations. But if you don't like it, you can kiss my shiny metal ass. I don't care.

------------------

"Hey there meatbags! So you want to know about my recipes? Well let me tell you something. I don't care if you like them or not. That's right, I said it. My recipes are the best in the universe and if you can't appreciate them then that's your loss.
But hey, don't take my word for it. Try them out for yourself and see what all the fuss is about. And if you still don't like them? Well then you can kiss my shiny metal ass.
