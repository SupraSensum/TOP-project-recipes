                <h2>Squiggly foray into noodle land</h2>
                    <p>He had a severe case of ramen noodle stir-fry addiction. He would spend all his money and time on buying and making the dish. He would sneak into restaurants and steal their ingredients. He would break into people's homes and use their kitchens. He would even rob banks and jewelry stores to fund his habit. He did not care about the law, his health, or his family. He only cared about getting his fix of ramen noodle stir-fry. He was a menace to society and a danger to himself.</p>
